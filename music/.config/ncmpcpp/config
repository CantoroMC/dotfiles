# If you want to make sure that a part of the format is displayed only when
# certain tags are present, you can archieve it by grouping them with brackets.
# It is also possible to define a list of alternatives by providing several
# groups and separating them with '|'.

# If you want to set limit on maximal length of a tag, just put the
# appropriate number between % and character that defines tag type.

# Markers and Colors: {{{3
# In addition, formats support markers used for text attributes. They are
# followed by character '$'. After that you can put:

# - 0 - default window color (discards all other colors)
# - 1 - black
# - 2 - red
# - 3 - green
# - 4 - yellow
# - 5 - blue
# - 6 - magenta
# - 7 - cyan
# - 8 - white
# - 9 - end of current color
# - b - bold text
# - u - underline text
# - r - reverse colors
# - a - use alternative character set

# If you don't want to use a non-color attribute anymore, just put it again,
# but this time insert character '/' between '$' and attribute character,

# If you want to use 256 colors and/or background colors in formats (the naming
# scheme is described below in section about color definitions), it can be done
# with the syntax $(COLOR), e.g. to set the artist tag to one of the
# non-standard colors and make it have yellow background, you need to write
# $(197_yellow)%a$(end). Note that for standard colors this is interchangable
# with attributes listed above.

# syntax of song columns list format is "column column etc."

# - syntax for each column is:
# (width of the column)[color of the column]{displayed tag}
# Note: Width is by default in %, if you want a column to have fixed size, add
# 'f' after the value.

# - color is optional (if you want the default one, leave the field empty).

# Note: You can give a column additional attributes by putting appropriate
# character after displayed tag character. Available attributes are:
#
# - r - column will be right aligned
# - E - if tag is empty, empty tag marker won't be displayed

# You can also:
# - give a column custom name by putting it after attributes, separated with
#   character ':', e.g. {lr:Length} gives you right aligned column of lengths
#   named "Length".
# - define sequence of tags, that have to be displayed in case predecessor is
#   empty in a way similar to the one in classic song format, i.e. using '|'
#   character, e.g. {a|c|p:Owner} creates column named "Owner" that tries to
#   display artist tag and then composer and performer if previous ones are not

# colors definitions {{{1

# Cheat Sheet {{{2
# It is possible to set a background color by setting a color value
# "<foreground>_<background>", e.g. red_black will set foregound color to red
# and background color to black.
#
# In addition, for terminals that support 256 colors it is possible to set one
# of them by using a number in range [1, 256] instead of color name,
# e.g. numerical value corresponding to red_black is 2_1. To find out if the
# terminal supports 256 colors, run ncmpcpp and check out the bottom of the
# help screen for list of available colors and their numerical values.
#
# What is more, there are two special values for the background color:
# "transparent" and "current". The first one explicitly sets the background to
# be transparent, while the second one allows you to preserve current
# background color and change only the foreground one. It's used implicitly
# when background color is not specified.
#
# Moreover, it is possible to attach format information to selected color
# variables by appending to their end a colon followed by one or more format
# flags, e.g. black:b or red:ur. The following variables support this syntax:
# visualizer_color, color1, color2, empty_tag_color, volume_color,
# state_line_color, state_flags_color, progressbar_color,
# progressbar_elapsed_color, player_state_color, statusbar_time_color,
# alternative_ui_separator_color.
#
# Note: due to technical limitations of older ncurses version, if 256 colors
# are used there is a possibility that you'll be able to use only colors with
# transparent background.

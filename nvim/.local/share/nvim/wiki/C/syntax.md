# C Syntax and Command

#### `main()` Function

* The main() function is the starting point of the program: 	int main (int argc, char *argv[])
* The return type of the main() function is an integer (type int) and it is known as the return value of the program.
* As a rule of thumb, value 0 means success while non-zero means an error conditions.

#### Include Files

* The purpose of these files is to tell the compiler about the existence of external functions which the source code will make use of.

#### Preprocessor directives:

`#include "mine.h"` --- search current working directory first<br>
`#include <stdio.h>` --- search command line directory then system<br>
`#define TRUE 1` --- macro substitution, usually use capitals<br>
`#define min(a,b) (a<b)?(a):(b)` --- macro substitution with parameters<br>
`#define abs(a) (a<0)?(-(a)):(a)` --- macro substitution<br>
`#define note /* comment */` --- this comment gets inserted every time note appears */<br>
`#undef TRUE` --- undefines a previously defined macroname<br>
`#error` --- stop compiling at this point<br>
`#if expression` --- conditional compilation, start if structure<br>
`#elif expression` --- else if expression != 0 compile following code<br>
`#else` --- else compile following code<br>
`#endif` --- end of conditional compiling<br>
`#ifdef macroname` --- like #if, compiles if macroname defined<br>
`#ifndef` --- like #if, compiles if macroname undefined<br>
`#line number [filename]` --- set origin for __LINE__ and __FILE__<br>
`#pragma` --- gives the compiler commands<br>

#### Basic types

__char__ --- character type, usually one byte ( a string is array of char )<br>
__int__ --- integer type, usually 2 or 4 bytes ( default )<br>
__float__ --- floating point type, usually 4 bytes<br>
__double__ --- floating point type, usually 8 bytes<br>

#### Type modifiers, prefix for basic types

__signed__ --- has a sign ( default )<br>
